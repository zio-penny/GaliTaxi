### 0.0.32 - 20230527

    Hi! This is the first changelog devlog entry thing! I'm kinda doing this for my own notes, but welcome!

    Not a big change today. In 0.0.31, finished up reworking the lander controller using an interface for the lander's input. Hopefully it will be easier to add controls for an NPC, or use with networking (like FishNet).

Next, I'll work on the humanoid player controller and follow up with a transition to NPC controller inputs.

#### Up Next:

humanoid player controller

#### TODOs:

humanoid/lander interaction, npc controller for humanoid, sounds, game loop, UI

#### Wishlist:

npc controller for lander, multiple ships
