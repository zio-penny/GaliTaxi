the chillest devlog

## game overview

In its simplest, GaliTaxi is a recreation of classic lunar lander games and, perhaps obviously, Space Taxi.

I'm planning to add other features, like deep space travel, and mining!

### 2023.08.12

##### 0.0.33

> Hi! I'm back. Took a little break. Got distracted by TotK, then D4, learning classical music on ukulele, work.. um.. ya know!
> 
> Updated to Unity Editor 2022.3.6f1. Thinking about how ECS and DOTS could help with this game... and immediately squashed the idea. Out of scope.. for now.
> 
> Anyways, I was planning to finish out humanoids, but then I saw this tiktok about breaking up the game to parts: https://www.tiktok.com/@derrickvfields/video/7261010373413817643
> 
> So, with that, I think I have a good enough lander system for now and wanted to start on the deep space travel system. Basically, a golf game! Putting for conventional space, and driving for hyperspace jumps.
> 
> ... where do I even start?..

### 2023.05.27

##### 0.0.32

> Hi! This is the first changelog devlog entry thing! I'm kinda doing this for my own notes, but welcome!
> 
> Not a big change today. In 0.0.31, finished up reworking the lander controller using an interface for the lander's input. Hopefully it will be easier to add controls for an NPC, or use with networking (like FishNet).
> 
> Next, I'll work on the humanoid player controller and follow up with a transition to NPC controller inputs.
